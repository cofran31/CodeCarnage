## A note for Mac users
In order to run the program, you may have to enable a setting to "Allow apps downloaded from Anywhere".  See [this](https://mac-how-to.gadgethacks.com/how-to/open-third-party-apps-from-unidentified-developers-mac-os-x-0158095/) for more information.

### Other Devices

If you cannot access a Linux Device, we recommend using a Virtual Environment with Fedora, as this is a tested environment.
To do this, see http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Fedora-17-in-Virtualbox (while the article is slightly outdated, the procedure is extremely similar).

You could also try to follow the **Linux and Mac** instructions at your own risk.
